## Description

A fleet ot **two** satellites which receives tasks from a single ground station is simulated as three different Python processes as below: 

![](./images/socket_diagram.png)  
*Socket communication diagram*

### Tasks

Task abstraction *(as a Python object from the ground station)* can be shown here:

![](./images/task_class.png)  
*Task class*

#### Tasks simulation

A batch of tasks is built using the [faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/#) library for the names *(that must be unique)*, and random numbers for the resources that each one requires and the payoff.

### Satellites ðŸ›°
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ satellites
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ satellite.py
```  
Satellite abstraction *(as a Python object from the ground station)* can be shown here:

![](./images/satellite_class.png)  
*Satellite class*

Each satellite is a socket server process listening for tasks to solve.
When a batch of tasks arrives, they take a random time to solve it.

> It has a 10% chance of fail trying to solve a task.

It sends back a message with the result of solving tasks through the socket connection.

Two satellites have exactly the same behaviour:
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ satellites
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ hamburguesat.py
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ milanesat.py
```

### Ground station ðŸ“¡

Its abstraction is conformed by a socket client process which sends the tasks assigned to every single satellite throught the corresponding socket server.

In addition to all logic related to: 
- assign the required tasks according to their **payoff optimization**
- connect and send them through the corresponding socket connection
- log events

### Payoff optimization

In order to maximize the payoff of the batch of tasks to assign:

```python
from utils.utils import build_fake_tasks

tasks_to_assign = build_fake_tasks()
print(tasks_to_assign)
```

```json
{"trouble": {"resources": [2, 3], "payoff": 3.85},
  "one": {"resources": [2, 3], "payoff": 1.99},
  "public": {"resources": [1, 2], "payoff": 1.94}}
```

- *All* possible combination of tasks in three *(number of sat + 1)* groups is determined:
  - Tasks designated to the first satellite *(Milanesat)*
  - Tasks designated to the second satellite *(Hamburguesat)*
  - Tasks that without designation.
  - First two groups are the groups of interest from here:

```python
from utils.tasks_optimization import *

all_task_combinations = get_all_tasks_combinations([task for task in tasks_to_assign])
print(all_task_combinations)

[
  [['hard'], ['national']], 
  [['hard'], ['national', 'represent']], 
  [['hard'], ['represent']], 
  [['hard', 'national'], ['represent']], 
  [['national'], ['hard', 'represent']], 
  [['national'], ['represent']]
]
```
- Optimizer works now with the subset of combination that *are possible* according to resources required:

```python
tasks_resources = {
    task: tasks_to_assign[task]["resources"] for task in tasks_to_assign
}
tasks_payoff = {name: tasks_to_assign[name]["payoff"] for name in tasks_to_assign}


possible_combinations = get_possible_task_combinations(
        all_task_combinations, tasks_resources
)

print(possible_combinations)

[
  [['trouble'], ['one']], 
  [['trouble'], ['public']], 
  [['one'], ['public']]
]
```

* It sorts the possible combinations by accumulated payoff for each group of two sets of tasks:

```python
combination_payoff = {}

for combination in possible_combinations:
    total_payoff = 0
    for pair in combination:
        total_payoff += sum([tasks_payoff[task] for task in pair])
    combination_payoff[round(total_payoff, 2)] = combination

sorted(combination_payoff.items(), reverse=True)

[(5.84, [['trouble'], ['one']]),
 (5.79, [['trouble'], ['public']]),
 (3.93, [['one'], ['public']])]
```

* And finally it finds the best combination of tasks that maximize the payoff:
  * 'trouble' task for Milanesat
  * 'one' task for Hamburguesat
  * 'public' task is not going to be assigned
